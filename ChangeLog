    Do not automatically enable the linux kernel's BPF JIT compiler
    
    The default value of kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is 0 which means
    this is enabling the BPF JIT compiler for unprivileged users. Given that
    this is a known attack vector for Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) this
    is not a setting that a utility should be tampering with.
    
    Tshark's and dumpcap's help message is changed by Balint Reczey to suggest
    enabling BPF manually after considering security-related implications.

Date:   Thu Dec 28 20:58:38 2017 -0800

    Do the right check for "no name resolution information to save".
    
    The check that the pcapng code does is "do we have a non-null
    addrinfo_lists_t * and, if so, does it have a non-null ipv4_addr_list or
    ipv6_addr_list"?
    
    The check that the file-save code was using was just "do we have a
    non-null addrinfo_lists_t *", so sometimes it'd think we couldn't do a
    "quick save" even though we had no name resolution information to write
    out to the capture file.
    
    Make a routine that does that check, and use it in *both* places.

    Qt: Resolve duplicate keyboard shortcuts
    
    Two Edit->Copy methods are using the same keyboard shortcut as other
    functionality:
    
    1. Ctrl+Shift+D is used for "Copy this item's description" and
       "Ignore All Displayed packets"
    
    2. Ctrl+Shift+F is used for "Copy this item's field name" and
       "Reload as File Format/Capture"
    
    Resolve this by changing the Copy methods to use Ctrl+Alt+Shift as modifier.
    Add a keyboard shortcut for "Copy all visible items" while here.

    qt: follow stream: fix crash during close
    
    The Follow Stream dialogue's button "Filter out this stream" filters out
    the stream's packets and then closes the Follow Stream dialogue. This may
    take a moment. If the user presses the Close button while the filtering
    is still running, the dialogue will be closed twice. This causes a crash
    which can be seen in ASAN builds.
